Exploring and finding insights from a bike company dataset.<br>

## Introduction
This project is an entry-level project which is about helping a bike company marketing analytics team to create and retrieve insights from the 2022 dataset.
As a junior data analyst in the company, our stakeholders are :
* The director of marketing who is our manager, 
* the marketing analytics team, and
* the executive team who decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.<br>
For context purposes, the company offers bike service which attracts  two types of clients: the members who have an annual subscription and the casual riders.
For the current year, the marketing team decides to increase the number of annual members because they are more profitable. Therefore, they want to convert the casual
clients into annual members.<br>
In conclusion, for this project, our business task is to answer to the question " How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently?"

## Business task
In the business task, we are trying to compare the member’s habits with the casual riders’ ones. 
It can be in terms of average time spent on the bikes, average time of the day of most users, and average period days of the week most riding. 
Based on the data we found, the marketing team can use those data in their advertising in order to convince casual
users to spend one unique subscription instead of multiple payments. <br>

## Data analysis phases
Here are the [data analysis](https://github.com/Rasoir-genereux/Data-analysis-project_1/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20phases.md) phases in details

## Dashboard
To make the findings easy to understand, [here](https://github.com/Rasoir-genereux/Data-analysis-project_1/tree/main/Dashboard) are the visualisations made based on the SQL queries.<br>

## Findings
After creating and looking at the visualizations, we come to this conclusion: Members use the bikes mostly on office days,
probably to commute to work. Therefore, they use bikes more frequently than casual riders. On the other hand,
Casual riders use the bikes on weekends and they spend more time riding than members.
It’s cold because they don’t have a specific place to go. Finally, only casual riders use docked bikes. 
These findings show that casual members only want to use the bikes for a limited time on weekends.

## Recommendations
These findings show that casual members only want to use the bikes for a limited time on weekends.<br>
So the advertising could be done in a way that makes the membership customize the casual riders for a period like in summer.
