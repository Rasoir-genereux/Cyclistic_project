## Introduction
This project is an entry level project which is about helping a bike company marketing analyics team to create retrieve insights from the 2022 dataset.
As a junior data anlayst in the company, our stakeholders are :
* the director of marketing who is our manager, 
* the marketing analytics team and
* the executive team who decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.<br>
For a context purpose, the company offers bike service which attracts  two type of client: the members who have an annual subscription and the casual riders.
For the current year, the marketing team decide to increase the number of annual members because they are more profitable. Therefore, they want to convert the casual
clients into annual members.<br>
In conclusion, for this project our business task is to answer to the question " How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently?"

## Business task
In the business task, we are trying to compare the member’s habits with the casual riders’ ones. 
It can be in term of average time spent on the bikes, average time of the day of most users, average period days of the week most riding. 
Based on the data we found, the marketing team can use those data in their advertising in order to convince the casual
users to spend one unique subscription instead of multiple payments. <br>

## Findings
After creating and looking at the visualizations, we come theses conclusion: Members use the bikes mostly in office days,
probably to commute to work. Therefore, they use the bikes more frequently than casual riders. In the other hand,
Casual riders use the bikes on weekends and they spend more time riding than members.
It’s could because they don’t have a specific place to go. Finally, only casual riders use docked bike. 
These findings show that casual members only want to use the bikes for a limited time on weekends.
